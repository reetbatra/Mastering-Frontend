# Mastering-Frontend
Here I attempt to master frontend one day at a time!

Resources I am using:
- [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) to learn.
- [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/app) to practice.
- Practicing react for coding interviews [here](https://www.reacterry.com/).
- Planning to take [this](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-full-stack-react-course) after completing scrimba and angela.
