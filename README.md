# Mastering-Frontend
Here I attempt to master frontend one day at a time!

Currently using [scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) to learn.

*Day 1:* Made a google website clone using HTML and CSS deployed [here](https://649dcf373e698c18c26861d2--graceful-vacherin-f143db.netlify.app/)
*Day 2:* Basic Personal portfolio site deployed [here](https://649c9d59d4189221228450ba--stunning-centaur-117f76.netlify.app/).
